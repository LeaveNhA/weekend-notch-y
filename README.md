```bash
# assuming your widgets are in the default Übersicht location
$ git clone https://github.com/LeaveNhA/weekend-notch-y ~/Library/Application\ Support/Übersicht/widgets/leavenha.notchy
```

### Font

As font, widget uses `Hack Nerd Font`.

## Dependencies

- [Spotify](https://spotify.com/) (dictated) — can be installed via `brew install spotify`. Widget uses Spotify as a main music application, yet. More application support is on the way.

## Usage

In Übersicth, for notch-index widget, select show on Built-in Display, to be sure that widget only will render on the Built-in Display. That's because, widget is meant to mimic Dynamic Island on MacBook display.

### Refreshing yabai workspaces widget

This library doesn't require any Yabai sided refreshing, yet. Until then, stay focused!
